# K-Lang
K-Lang (Katana Language) is an programming language in development.
The goal is to create an programming language which is memory safe and has an C/C++ like syntax so developers dont have to move from C/C++ syntax.
Only a few things have been changed in the syntax.
# **Note:** The project is still in it's early stages so stuff might break, if you encounter any issue report at the Issues pages of our repo.
